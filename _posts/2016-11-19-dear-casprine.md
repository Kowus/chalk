#### Dear Casprine,
Allow me to express my sincere gratitude to you and your friends for showing up, you overcame your first obstacle in learning-- by being serious and getting involved.
There are many people who _"Want to learn to write code."_ But never dedicate the time to it.

Like Morpheus, I can as much as show you the door, walking through it is up to you. You'll soon realise that I did nothing but show you what you are capable of achieving if you believe yourself and work hard towards actualising your dreams.
Walking through the door means knowing what you want; overcoming challenges to get what you want, and knowing why you want what you want-- why do you want to be a programmer?

You wanted to know how to contribute positively to society,

>"Be the change you wish to see"

See  a lot of people don't understand why I do what I do and why I love to teach. The most honest explanation I can give is this:

> I know the value of learning to program a computer -- it teaches you to think. It shows you that you are capable of solving your own problems-- but many people don't know this, and I try to remind people everyday the importance of this, I try to remind them that all hope is not lost for the future of Ghana, that every individual has the power to solve his own problems if that person is put in the right environment or given the right tools, yet that individual may never be able to solve such problems if he doesn't know how to use the tools he has, or if he cannot relate well with his environment. 

But I can't do it all alone, a lot of young people here are living without hope, and it's contagious-- like crabs in a barrel, when one tries to crawl out... you know how that goes-- it's just the theory of man: 

> ### "People fear what they can't understand,  hate what they can't conquer ". 
> We are afraid that the "something new" that's before us is going to take us away from our "comfort zone ", but look at our country, do you like what you see, does the comfort zone look in the least bit appealing to you? Are  we going to just complain and do nothing and wait for an honest politician to come solve our problems?

_i.e. if the politician doesn't have a pot belly of his own to take care of_. I don't want to see another of my friends live without hope, I'm tired of seeing a lot of my homeboys  participating in Internet  fraud or scams or whatever. It's becoming a big problem and I know you feel my pain, you might have probably got blocked from using some good stuff on the internet because your IP was flagged suspicious or if lots of people preconceive you as a scammer because of where you come from. I want us to convert that negative energy into a movement so powerful it can shake the very foundations of the earth. We can use the fact that Ghana is now developing to our advantage and create real solutions to problems. The only way to go is through an Empowering Education, Technology and Design. The young people are not the problem,  the young people are the solution. We are the past and the future of development. If we can shift our minds from 
> "waiting for a white man on a white horse from the sky"

 to 
> "I can do all things..."

I tell you there's a lot we can achieve.

There's no better time or place to be born than _**now**_, in _**Ghana**_. So next time you recite the national pledge,  or sing the national anthem,  or shout 'hey!' On the school anthem,  do it with pride, for change is in the air, it's coming, and you are a part of it, and when that day comes, we'll all stand together.
It goes without saying that a great door of effective work has been open unto you, and there are many who will oppose you; but
>   Let no man despise thy youth! 
>###### --1 Timothy 4: 12a

And your future will be golden
